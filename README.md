# Musically Informed Data Representations for Automatic Music Transcription


The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative data representations in symbolic music modeling. They will be tested both as a model output and as a latent space representation.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Traditional 2D array
- Spiral note array
- Torus
- Tonnetz graphs  

The general pipelines I'll try for now is the following:
